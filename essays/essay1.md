Hey class. This week we worked on WODS 1-3 dealing with browser history. It was a very interesting topic and somethings that I had a challenge with were sticking under the time limits to get the RX.
I am not the best coding so for me and thinking out loud and going with the WOD video made me stress and lose train of thought. I do believe once you do know what to expect in the WOD will make it easier for you to code what you need.
What helps is to close out all programs or set your computer to do not disturb. Have your work space nice and clean with zero two to no distractions around. Find the time where it is quite and no one will bother you.
I also feel that it helps to just restart if you mix it. Go back through and see what maybe the error. Before doing the WODs I try to work through the problems without a timer so that I don't feel the stress. Once I know how to approach the WOD than I record
myself and commentate what is occur in the WOD.

WOD 1 had to deal with building the page and putting the detail with clickable links to the source. What I did was set the links aside so I wouldn't have to be scrambling to look for the links.

WOD 2 had to deal with style.css and changing the color of the page. No challenge.

WOD 3 had to deal with style.css and adding a nav bar. My nav bar keeps bugging out. I do not know if its my code or if its the page or something else.
