  - Why I majored in MIS
---

I decided to major in MIS because I wanted to go into a field dealing with computers. I'm not really a technical specialist but I'm more of an infrastructure, endpoint user, computer builder.
I currently work at Bank of Hawaii in the endpoint department as a student assitant. I hope to stay there and one day manage the department. MIS would help me get to that goal.
