The WOD we worked on this week had to do with a invoice page that would take the cost of items and calculate. It was also to show how a table functions and works.

What was hard about this would was getting the table and understanding the new tags that we had to input instead of the example table that the picture on the Invoice 
Page had. It was also very confusing in the beginning how to make the comments because my comments wouldn't become comments without a specific bracket.

I prepared by reading the text and going over the class videos. I ended having to refer to the example video for the able because of the new tags and not working on my 
end.

I would look at the class material more indepth. A lot would be having to do problem solving and being able to adapt and change your code.
